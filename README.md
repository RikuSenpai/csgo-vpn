Have your CSGO client think you are from a different country. This does **not** change the gameserver you connect to. This is **only** for things such as cases.

It allows you to let your CSGO client think you are from a different country to, for example, obtain a Genuine P250 | X-Ray or open cases if you're from a country where opening cases has been disabled.
