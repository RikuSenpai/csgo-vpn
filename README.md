# CSGO VPN

Have your CSGO client think you are from a different country. This does **not** change the gameserver you connect to. This is **only** for things such as cases.

It allows you to let your CSGO client think you are from France without modifying your Steam settings or use a real VPN. This way you can buy the P250 | X-Ray easily!
